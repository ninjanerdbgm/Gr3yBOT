# The following function was developed from an idea put forth by 
# George Marsaglia.  It is used for all the dice rolls.  From Wikipedia:
#
# Xorshift generators are among the fastest non-cryptographic random number generators requiring minimal code and state. 
# Although they do not pass every statistical test without further refinement, this weakness is well-known and easily amended 
# by combining them with a non-linear function, resulting e.g. in a xorshift+ or xorshift* generator. 
# A naive C implementation of a xorshift+ generator that passes all tests from the BigCrush suite (with an order of magnitude 
# fewer failures than Mersenne Twister or WELL) typically takes fewer than 10 clock cycles on x86 to generate a random number thanks to instruction pipelining.
#
# The following implementation was refined by bgm:
