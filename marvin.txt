i am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you all.
my capacity for happiness you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.
i could calculate your chance for survival, but you wont like it
id give you all advice, but you wont listen. no one ever does
i ache, therefore i am
you are all the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.
here i am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to sit in this chat room and cater to you all.
pardon me for breathing, which i never do anyway, so i dont know why i bother to say it
funny how just when you think life cant possibly get any worse it suddenly does
im just trying to die
i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed
not that anyone cares what i say, but the restaurant is on the other end of the universe
life.  dont talk to me about life.
